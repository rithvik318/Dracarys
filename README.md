## 🎮 Game Overview

**Dracarys** elevates the original Dino Game by adding **combat and survival mechanics**:

- 🔥 **Fire-breathing Dino**: Attack incoming flying enemies with projectile flames
- 🦅 **Enemy Birds**: Aerial enemies that launch attacks and damage the dino
- ❤️ **Health System**: The dino gains health gradually over time but loses it when hit
- ⚡ **Speed Scaling**: Game speed increases progressively to raise the challenge
- 🧠 **Smarter Interactions**: Dynamic enemy behavior and more complex player controls

This project blends the simplicity of endless runners with action-combat elements for a unique hybrid gameplay experience.
